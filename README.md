BOINC-MST-Creator
=================

A continuation of the BOINC MST Creator originally developed by "The Lazy Slug"

## A Quick Introduction  
Even if you have only a few PCs in your office or home network, you have to go to each machine to install and configure BOINC, which all takes time.

This is where this project can help.

Fortunately the BOINC installation package for Windows uses the built-in Microsoft Installer (MSI files). As everyone needs to install their software in a different way, the MSI database can be modified using a MST file, which allows you to predefine your project settings, shortcuts, screen-savers, installation type, etc. for all of your PCs in one go.

As it can be a little tricky creating a MST for the novice (and time consuming for experts), I have written a VB Script file, with an easy-to-complete form that will create the MST in a couple of seconds.

There are detailed instructions on how to deploy BOINC to your network from a Windows Server, even if you have had no experience of doing this, together with some troubleshooting tips I have gathered together, plus a quick way to update your BOINC version if required.

For the more technically minded of you out there, the scripts are in VBScript which you are free to use in your own versions (and probably improve on!). If you have any restrictions on which files you can download, the text of the scripts can be viewed in a popup window.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any problems or have an idea on how the script can be improved.

**NOTE: If you're deploying BOINC across your company network, make sure you get permission first.**
